# Verification {#verification}

The engine is checked against **three oracles**, and they are not equal in authority.

**The C# engine** — the archived
[DotNetAdministravit](https://github.com/TabulaSonora/DotNetAdministravit), which this port was
written against phase by phase. It is the closest oracle and the strictest: the bar here is
bit-exactness, not similarity.

**The reference implementation** — the Python in the
[spec repository](https://github.com/TabulaSonora/spec) — is swept over whole input domains to
produce expected values. This catches the sign-extension, truncation-direction and integer-width
mistakes that a port invites.

**The real `SCCore.dll`'s own captured internal state** — per-voice gain, filter registers,
controller sweeps, taken with the spec repository's `scdec` harness. Where these disagree, **the
hardware wins**.

## What the port itself is held to

Against the C# engine the gates are digests, not tolerances. Each compares this engine's output to
a fixture generated from the C# CLI:

| gate | tag | comparison |
|---|---|---|
| single note | `[render][sccore][gate]` | SHA-256 of the whole render plus eight literal samples, over 100+ cases |
| whole song, offline | `[song][sccore][gate]` | SHA-256, across 20 option variants |
| block loop, real time | `[stream][sccore][gate]` | the whole reference WAV: worst error ≤ 1 LSB, under 0.02% of samples differing |
| predictor stream | `[sampler][sccore][gate]` | against an independent decoder |

Only the real-time gate has any tolerance at all, and it is one LSB.

The fixtures are Roland-derived and so are not committed. Each pins the DLL's SHA-256 and is
regenerated locally by the scripts in `tools/`; a gate whose fixture index is missing skips with the
command that would produce it rather than failing. The test data itself comes from `TS_SCCORE` and
`TS_TABLES`, or is discovered beside the repository, and anything unfindable is skipped rather than
failed.

## What is proven

These results were established for the C# engine against the reference and the DLL. They carry
over because this engine reproduces that one bit for bit:

| | result |
|---|---|
| static tables | all 48 byte-identical to the extracted cache |
| sample codec | bit-exact against the engine's own predictor |
| patch directory | 470 of 512 programs reproduce the engine's observed zones |
| per-voice gain | within **5.4e-05** of the engine's gain word |
| filter cutoff | **0.10%** mean error over a 2.4 s sweep |
| pitch and LFO | exact against the reference, tick for tick |
| pan law | within **3.0e-05** of a measured controller sweep |
| send effects | all 26 networks matched by impulse response |
| full song | ~1 LSB against the reference over 7.9 million samples |

## The goal is audible fidelity, not bit accuracy

Worth stating before the departures below, because it is what licenses them. This applies to the
comparison against the *hardware*, not against the C# engine — that one is exact.

Individual layers are held to bit exactness where the hardware is deterministic: tables, codec,
tick streams. The rendered output is not, and the comparison against the DLL asserts correlation,
level and spectrum against stated tolerances instead.

Part of the residual is inaudible by construction. In a dense passage the few-millisecond amplitude
envelope is dominated by beating between simultaneous notes, which is chaotically sensitive:
onestop's harpsichord section correlates at 0.72 on a 4 ms envelope, rises to 0.91 as the window
widens to 250 ms, and matches the DLL's spectrum within 0.5 dB in every band. Nothing there is
wrong. A metric that looks bad is a lead to investigate, not a defect in itself.

`tools/compare_render.py` computes those correlation and RMS figures. It is a diagnostic for
judging a residual against the DLL, not a test gate — nothing in the suite passes on correlation.

## Where this engine departs from the reference

Four cases, each deliberate, each because the hardware was measured and disagreed.

**The loop's last sample.** The reference stops decoding one sample short of a loop's data end, so
its forward loop substitutes the loop's *first* sample for the last and plays it twice per pass.
The hardware does not.

On long loops this is inaudible. On the SC-55 glockenspiel, whose loops are 60–161 samples, it was
audible as glitchiness — and it also dulled the timbre measurably:

| note | centroid before | after | real DLL |
|---|---|---|---|
| 91 | 6192 Hz | 7333 Hz | 7434 Hz |
| 96 | 7390 Hz | 8857 Hz | 8912 Hz |

This engine follows the hardware: the loop period is inclusive of the data end, asserted in
`sampler_tests.cpp`. Looping is decided by whether a sustain region exists rather than by the
descriptor's loop flag, which is asserted beside it.

**Note-off waits for the control tick.** The reference releases at the note-off sample; the engine
acts on it at its next 100 Hz tick. Measured by sweeping the hold past a boundary — note-off
anywhere in 1000–1008 ms produced the same release, which stepped a whole tick later at 1010 ms,
and one landing exactly on a tick still waited a full one. Releasing immediately runs the tail up
to 10 ms early: inaudible on a pad, most of a short release. Across seven patches this took the
release-onset error from 6.0 ms to 2.3 ms. `ts::SegmentEnvelope::defer_to_control_tick` is the
implementation, and `modulation_tests.cpp` asserts that a note-off landing exactly on a boundary
still waits a full tick.

**The filter envelope's velocity response.** The reference feeds raw MIDI velocity to the depth
scaler. The engine feeds it through one of sixteen response curves selected by `block[0x2e]` —
ts::PartialParameters::velocity_curve here, indexing the `g_vel_sens` rows of ts::TableSet. Row 0
is the identity, so most of the library agrees either way; 13.5% of filtered partials do not.
Brass 1 selects row 1, which reads velocity 100 as 71 — on raw velocity its filter sits about a
third of an octave too open for the whole note, measuring +3.5 dB at 4–8 kHz and +6.3 dB above it.

**A note re-struck under the sustain pedal.** A note-off arriving with the damper down is parked
rather than acted on. The reference leaves that parked entry in place when the note is re-struck,
so the pedal's lift releases the strike the player is still holding. This engine clears it: a new
strike supersedes a note-off the pedal is still holding for that note. onestop.mid's harpsichord
passage rides the pedal every half second over constantly re-struck notes and loses 24 notes to the
reference behaviour — all of them in that passage, none elsewhere in the song, each cut 20–80 ms
after sounding.

\note The last two are enforced by the digest gates rather than by tests named for them. They are
load-bearing for a byte-identical render, so a regression in either shows up as a failed SHA-256,
but the failure will not name the cause.

## Where the reference departs from its own manual

**Part EQ defaults off, and the SC-8820 manual says on.** The manual's parameter table gives
`40 4x 20` (EQ ON/OFF) a default of `01 ON`. In the reference engine the part reset writes
`part+0x450` to zero, and **nothing anywhere in the binary ever writes one to it** — the only path
that sets it is the SysEx handler itself. A module that is never told to switch the EQ on therefore
never does.

This engine follows the binary, in ts::Part::eq_enabled. The disagreement is silent until a stream
also sends a non-flat `40 02`: a flat EQ is exactly transparent, so with the block at its defaults
both readings sound identical. On a stream that sets an EQ curve without ever addressing
`40 4x 20`, they differ completely — one hears the EQ on every part, the other on none.

\warning This has not been checked against the DLL as an oracle, only read out of it. It is the
one claim on this page resting on absence of evidence rather than measurement, and a file that sets
`40 02` and no part EQ would settle it in a single render.

## Known limits

Stated plainly, because they are not covered by the numbers above:

- **Voice stealing is an approximation.** The original's allocator was located and named during
  reverse engineering but its selection rules were never traced. The policy in ts::VoicePool — free
  slot, then oldest releasing note, then oldest held note — is an invention, isolated so it can be
  replaced without touching any DSP. The test that covers it says so in as many words.
- **The LFO has no hardware trace.** It is verified against the reference, which the spec project
  separately reports as bit-exact against the live engine. That is one link removed from the DLL.
- **Insertion EFX is out of scope**, as it is upstream. The 67-algorithm subsystem is not
  implemented; the GS SysEx that selects it is parsed and dropped.
- **Drum tones with the 4-partial layout are not reversed** upstream. A melodic tone here has two
  partial slots (ts::Tone::partial_slots), and asking for more throws rather than guessing. General
  MIDI kits resolve to ordinary melodic tones, so the common path works.
- **LFO random waveforms** need the engine's own RNG state and return zero, as in the reference.
  Waveform selectors 1, 2 and 3 are the affected ones.

## Methodology worth borrowing

Two habits earned their place during development:

**Guard against passing vacuously.** Twelve of the twenty-six effect comparisons were once green
while testing nothing at all — the fixture windows were shorter than the delays, so both sides were
silent and agreed perfectly. A "produced no output" assertion caught it.

**A narrow test set hides broad defects.** One MIDI file exercised no mod wheel and fifteen pitch
bends; three others used hundreds of each and immediately exposed two real bugs. The spec project
records the same lesson three separate times.
